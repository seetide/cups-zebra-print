# cups-zebra-print
label print with zebra printer on linux
In my work, I need to print the label with zebra printer lp2824 plus.

At the begining the program is developed in salesforce for windows platform.

I want to run it on the Ubuntu.

I need to install the pdf with: apt-get install cups-pdf. 
After add the printer, the browser can generate the pdf for print.
I need to modify the ppd file to get the correct size for the label paper.


In the end, I need to add --kiosk-print in the shortcut of the program.
